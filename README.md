# Dice-Game

## Project Functionality

Simulate a dice game between 2 players, announcing the winner (or draw).

The numbers are randomly generated everytime the page loads. There's a button to reload the page.

### Project Deployment
You can see the project deployed [here](https://preis8.github.io/Dice-Game/).

## Code Objectives

As a beginner, to practice JavaScript:
- Generate Random Numbers;
- DOM Manipulation (querySelectors, setAttribute);
- Functions;
- if / else / switch;

**Please note:** I'm aware that this is *not* the shortest solution, however I solved the problem this way to force myself to write more code.

## Credits and Context

The project was made under the course [The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/), on Udemy. All images and the page html and css files were already provided.

### Additions

The button on the page, as well as its CSS, was added by me.
